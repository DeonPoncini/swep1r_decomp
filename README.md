# Decompilation Information

This was decompiled from Star Wars Episode 1 Racer, Steam Version.

The original Ghidra information is available in the decompiled directory, with
the following modifications:
* Includes typedefs for the missing exported types
* Converted the FUN\_004238d0 function to WinMain as an entry point

This will not be changed further, and used for reference. The src directory
will attempt to get this code compiling, without trying to actually translate
the internals, just get types correct and the executable running.

This is to assist the main [decompiler effort](https://github.com/tim-tim707/SW_RACER_RE),
to get more information about the types in the function signatures and the DAT
variables
